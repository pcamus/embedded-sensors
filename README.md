## Embedded sensors repository.

In this repository, I will post information about sensors I have tested, describing their physical principle and interface together with code examples.

The targeted platforms will be the Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi Pico and Arduino. Languages will be C/C++, Python and MicroPython depending on the projects I'm working on.

- [DS18B20](/DS18B20) : OneWire temperature sensor.
- [VL53L1X](VL53L1X) : distance ranging ToF sensor.
- [ICM20948 & LPS22HB] (Pico_IMU_10DOF) : accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, temperature and pressure sensors
