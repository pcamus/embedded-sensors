## Embedded sensors repository.

In this repository, I will post information about sensors I have tested, describing their physical principle and interface together with code examples.

The targeted plateforms will be the Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi Pico and Arduino. Languages will be C/C++, Python and MicroPython according to what I have tested.
