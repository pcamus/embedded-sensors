## Embedded sensors repository.

In this repository, I will post some sensors I used with information about their physical principle, interfacing and code examples.The targeted plateforms will be Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi Pico and Arduino. Languages will be C/C++, Python and MicroPython depending of the sensor and plateform.
