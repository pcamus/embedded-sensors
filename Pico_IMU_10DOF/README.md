## Pico 10DOF IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit).

This repository is about a Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) module containing two sensors IC : 

- The ICM20948 which is a axis accelerometer, 3 axis gyroscope and 3 axis magnetometer. This circuit contains also a Digital Motion Processor (DMP) and a temperature sensor. The DMP runs a motion algorithm relieving the processor of this task. See the [datasheet](ICM-20948.pdf) for the detailed characteristics.
- The LPS22HB which is a barometric and temperature sensors. See the [datasheet](lps22hb.pdf) for the detailed characteristics.

The [schematic](Pico-10DOF-IMU_Sch.pdf) of the board gives details of the circuitry.
