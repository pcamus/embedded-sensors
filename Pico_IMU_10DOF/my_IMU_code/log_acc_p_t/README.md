## Logging of acceleration, pression and temperature.

Data are logged into binary files (one for X,Y,Z accelerations, one for pressure and temperature) stored in the flash memory of the Pico..

The binary format is used due to the small amount of flash memory available on the Pico.

A conversion program allows to convert the binary log files into csv files.
